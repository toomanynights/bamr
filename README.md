## What is this?
This is a batch script that help you repack mods for This War of Mine.
This script will only make sense to you if you read the [guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2912922403), so I suggest you start there.
## How to use it?
Simply put it in your python unpacker folder and launch. The script will ask all information it needs to work and write it into "config" file.
If you move the script to another machine, be sure to remove "config" file to configure the script again.
